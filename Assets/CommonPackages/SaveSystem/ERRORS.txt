If you want to use the SaveSytem, don't forget the "using SaveSystem;" statement.

If you have problems saving an object, these are the most common mistakes:

-) Your class must be public.
-) Your class must have a constuctor with no parameters.
-) Your class must have the [System.Serializable] attribute.
-) Your class must not derive from any other class.
